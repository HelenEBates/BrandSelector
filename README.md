Lots of womens clothes shops have slightly different sizes. This programme explores how to make find which brands fit you.
Data from River Island, Topshop and Zara size guides for size 12 dresses where used in the CSV file. The first value is bust, then waist, then hips.
The first step was to read in the file then allow the user to enter their own values.
For a good fit the user entered values need to be lower than each value from the brand
